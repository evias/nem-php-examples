## About this package

This package provides with *example integrations* of the [evias/nem-php](https://github.com/evias/nem-php) NEM SDK for PHP.

It should provide with features that are easy to reproduce and showcase how the `evias/nem-php` library can be integrated in your projects.

The laravel application *is only a wrapper* to provide with a web application that can be served on any of Apache or Nginx. Please use composer as mentioned in the following section.

## Installation

You will need to install `composer` first. Then clone this repository and install its dependencies as follows:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/evias/nem-php-examples
$ cd nem-php-examples
$ composer install
```

Now you are ready to test out the NEM SDK for PHP!

NEMjoy :)
